	 	* Return more than one column to the outer query.
	 	* Can be used with the FROM, WHERE or HAVING clauses.
	 	* Generally used with the IN or NOT IN operators.
	 	* There are two types of multiple-column subqueries:
	 		1. Non-pairwise Comparison Subquery
	 		2. Pairwise Comparison Subquery

	 	== Non-pairwise Comparison Subquery ==
	 		- Nonpairwise comparisons are like multiple-row subqueries with the IN
	 		  operator, that we check multiple column values with separate subqueries.

	 	== Pairwise Comparison Subquery ==
	 		- A subquery returning multiple columns is called "Pairwise Comparison
	 		  Subquery".

	 		*** Non-Pairwise Comparison Subquery ***
	 		SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, department_id, salary
			FROM employees
			WHERE department_id IN 
			                      (SELECT department_id FROM employees
			                       WHERE employee_id IN (103, 105, 110))
			AND salary IN 
			             (SELECT salary FROM employees
			             WHERE employee_id IN (103, 105, 110));

			*** Pairwise Comparison Subquery ***
	 		SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, department_id, salary
			FROM employees
			WHERE (department_id, salary) IN 
			            (SELECT department_id, salary FROM employees
			            WHERE employee_id IN (103, 105, 110));

			- We can write more than 2 columns and have a comparison of more than
			  2 columns at a time.
