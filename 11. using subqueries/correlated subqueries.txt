	 	* When a subquery references to the columns from the parent query, it is
	 	  called correlated subquery.
	 	* Correlated subqueries allow us to read every row in a table and compare
	 	  values for each row against the related data.
	 	* In regular subqueries, they are executed first and the result of the
	 	  subqueries are passed back to the parent query.
	 	* In correlated subqueries, a candidate row is selected from the main query
	 	  and used with the correlated subquery, and the result of this subquery is
	 	  used by the main query afterwards.
	 	* A correlated subquery is used for row by row processing. The subquery is
	 	  executed for each row of the main query.
	 	* A correlated subquery is also known as:
	 		- Repeating Subquery.
	 		- Synchronized Subquery.
	 	* We can use correlated subqueries with the logical operators (<, =, ...),
	 	  IN, ANY, ALL operators.
