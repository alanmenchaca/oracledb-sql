	 	* If a subquery returns only one column for one row, it is called a
	 	  Scalar Subquery.
	 	* If a scalar subquery returns NULL or 0 rows, the main query will
	 	  return nothing.
	 	* If a scalar subquery returns more than 1 row, the main query will
	 	  return an error.
	 	* Scalar subqueries can be used with:
	 		- SELECT Statements
	 		- DECODE function and CASE expressions
	 		- WHERE clauses
	 		- SET clauses of UPDATE statements
	 		- VALUES clauses of INSERT statements
	 		- ORDER BY clauses

	 	SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name FROM employees
		WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id 
		                       FROM employees 
		                       WHERE UPPER(first_name) = 'LUIS');

		SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, 
		    (CASE WHEN location_id=(SELECT location_id 
		                            FROM locations 
		                            WHERE postal_code='99236') THEN 'San Francisco'
		        ELSE 'Other'
		        END) AS "city"
		FROM employees e NATURAL JOIN departments d;
