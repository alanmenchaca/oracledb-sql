	 	* Single-row subqueries return only one row from the inner query.
	 	* Used with the single-row comparison operators (=, >, <, >=, <=, <>, !=).

	 	SELECT first_name, last_name, department_id 
		FROM employees
		WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id 
		                       FROM employees 
		                       WHERE employee_id = 145);

		* We can use more than one subquery in one main query.

		SELECT first_name, last_name, salary 
		FROM employees
		WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id 
		                       FROM employees 
		                       WHERE employee_id = 145)
		AND salary < (SELECT salary 
		              FROM employees 
		              WHERE employee_id = 145);

		* Group functions can be used in the single-row subqueries.

		SELECT first_name, last_name, hire_date
		FROM employees
		WHERE hire_date = 
						 (SELECT MIN(hire_date)
						  FROM employees);

		* If a single-row subquery returns multiple-rows, it generates an error.
		* If a subquery returns nothing or a NULL value, the main query will 
		  return nothing.

		SELECT first_name, last_name, hire_date
		FROM employees
		WHERE hire_date = 
						 (SELECT MIN(hire_date)
						  FROM employees
						  GROUP BY department_id);
