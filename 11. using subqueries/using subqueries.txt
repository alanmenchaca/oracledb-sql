	 	* A subquery is a SQL SELECT statement that is contained within another
	 	  SELECT statement.
	 		- Query 1 (Inner Query) -> Query 2 (Outer query) -> Final output

	 	SELECT column_names FROM table
	 		WHERE expression-operator
	 			(SELECT column_names FROM table);

	 	SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees 
		WHERE salary > 
		            (SELECT salary 
		             FROM employees 
		             WHERE employee_id = 145);

		* The inner query is also named "subquery" and outer query is also named
		  "main" or "parent" query.
		* A subquery is executed before the main query and the result of the subquery
		  is used by the main query.
		* Subqueries are enclosed with a parentheses.
		* Subqueries can be used with the SELECT, WHERE, HAVING and FROM clauses.
		* There are 3 types of subqueries:
			1. Single-row subqueries
			2. Multiple-row subqueries
			3. Multiple-column subqueries
