	
	 ~ Multiple-Row Subqueries ~
	 	* Return more than one row from the inner queries.
	 	* Used with multiple-row comparison operators (IN, ANY, ALL).
	 		1. IN Operator: Checks whether a value matches any values in a subquery.
	 		2. ANY Operator: Checks whether a value matches at least one value in a
	 		   subquery.
	 		3. ALL Operator: Checks whether a value matches all values in a subquery. 
	 	* Can be used with the FROM, WHERE or HAVING clauses.


	 ~ Using the "IN" Operator with Subqueries ~
	 	* The IN operator in multiple-row subqueries is used to return rows that match
	 	  with the elements of the inner query.

	 	SELECT first_name, last_name, department_id, salary
		FROM employees
		WHERE salary IN (SELECT MIN(salary) 
		                 FROM employees
		                 GROUP BY department_id);


	 ~ Using the "ANY" Operator with Subqueries ~
	 	* The ANY operator returns rows if at least one of the values returned from
	 	  the subquery meets the condition.
	 	* The ANY operator is used with the comparison operators (=, >, <, >=, <=, !=, <>).
		 	* < ANY means less than the maximum.
		 	* = ANY means equal to one of the elements (same as IN).
		 	* > ANY means more than the minimum.

	 	SELECT first_name, last_name, department_id, salary
		FROM employees
		WHERE salary > ANY 
		                   (SELECT salary 
		                   FROM employees 
		                   WHERE job_id = 'SA_MAN');

		SELECT first_name, last_name, department_id, salary
		FROM employees
		WHERE salary < ANY 
		                   (SELECT salary 
		                   FROM employees 
		                   WHERE job_id = 'SA_MAN');


	 ~ Using the "ALL" Operator with Subqueries ~
	 	* The ALL operator in multiple-row subqueries is used to return values which
	 	  provide the condition with all elements of the inner query.
		* The ALL operator is used with the comparison operators (=, >, <, >=, <=, !=, <>).
			* < ALL means less than the minimum.
			* = ALL means nothing if there are more than one records.
			* > ALL means more than the maximum.

		SELECT first_name, last_name, department_id, salary
		FROM employees
		WHERE salary < ALL 
		                   (SELECT salary 
		                   FROM employees 
		                   WHERE job_id = 'SA_MAN');
