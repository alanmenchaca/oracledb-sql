	 	* We can use a subquery after the FROM clause like using a table.
	 		- SELECT * FROM (SELECT state_province, city, department_id, department_name
	 		 				FROM departments JOIN locations USING (location_id));
	 	* This type of subqueries are also called the INLINE Views.
	 	* The INLINE Views are used as a source or a SELECT query like a table.
	 	* We can use more than one INLINE View in a SELECT statement.
	 	* The inline views must be surrounded by the parentheses

	 	SELECT * FROM (SELECT department_id, department_name , state_province, city
              FROM departments JOIN locations
              USING (location_id)
              ORDER BY department_id);

	 	SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, 
        	   b.department_name, b.city, b.state_prov ince
		FROM employees e INNER JOIN(
		              SELECT department_id, department_name , state_province, city
		              FROM departments JOIN locations
		              USING (location_id)
		              ORDER BY department_id) b
		USING (department_id);
