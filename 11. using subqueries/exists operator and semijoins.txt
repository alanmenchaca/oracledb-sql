	 	* We use the EXISTS operators to check the existence of rows in the subquery
	 	  and match the records between the subquery and main query.
			- EXISTS returns: True or False	 	  
	 	* The EXISTS operator is used with the correlated subqueries generally.
	 	* The EXISTS operator terminates the processing of the subquery once the
	 	  subquery returns the first row.
	 	* The subquery does not need to return a specific type of value. It can be
	 	  constant, a NULL or a column value.
	 	* The subquery can return more than one value.

	 	* Finding the managers using the EXISTS operator:

	 	SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, department_id
		FROM employees a
		WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1, employee_id
		              FROM employees
		              WHERE manager_id = a.employee_id);

		* A Semijoin between two tables returns rows that match an EXISTS or IN
		  subquery without duplicating the rows of the main query even when there
		  are multiple matches from the subquery.
			- The queries including the EXISTS or IN operators are considered as 
			  semijoins.

		* In summary, the EXISTS operator is used for testing the existence of the
		  rows in a query.
