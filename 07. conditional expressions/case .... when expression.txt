		* Expression and comparison_expressions must be in the same data type.
		* Can be used in both SELECT and WHERE clauses.

		* There are two ways of using the CASE expressions which are Simple Case
		  Expression and Searched Case Expression.
			- Simple Case Expression: The expression is stated at the beginning,
			  and the possible results are checked in the condition parameter.
				* CASE first_name
				  		WHEN 'Alex' THEN 'Name is Alex'
				  		WHEN 'John' THEN 'Name is John'

				  END
			- Searched Case Expression: The expressions are used within each
			  condition without mentioning it at the start of the CASE expression.
