	 	* In the query bellow, the index will no be used:
	 	SELECT * FROM employees WHERE UPPER(last_name) = 'KING';

	 	* Normally, to use an index, the indexed columns should be used the way the
	 	  index was created.
		* We can create indexed with Oracle's built in function or user-defined functions.

		CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (function_name(parameter,[parameter, ...]));

		* Function-based indexes store the results of functions.
		* If the same function is used in the CREATE INDEX statement as in the WHERE clause,
		  the query will use the related function-based index.
		* To create a function-based index, the QUERY REWRITE system privilege is required.
