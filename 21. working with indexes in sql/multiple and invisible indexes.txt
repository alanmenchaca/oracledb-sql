	 	* Multiple indexes can be created on the same set of columns if the indexes are
	 	  of different types.
	 	* If there are multiple indexes on the same set of columns, only onde index can
	 	  be visible at the time.
	 	* An index can be VISIBLE or INVISIBLE.
	 	* Invisible indexes continue to be maintained, but ignored by the optimizer on
	 	  query execution.
	 	* Making an index invisible can be an alternative to dropping and re-creating it,
	 	  or making it unusable.
	 	* An index can be made invisible to check its effect on performance.
	 		- Index maintenance stops when an index becomes unusable.
	 		- Invisible indexes should be dropped after completing performance tests.
	 	* Rebuilding an index will make it visible automatically.
	 	* Index can be created as invisible initially.
