	 	* There are many index types in the Oracle Database such as:
	 		- B-tree Indexes 
	 		- Bitmap Indexes
	 		- Bitmap Join Indexes
	 		- Function Based Indexes
	 		- Application Doman Indexes

	 	* B-Tree (Balanced Tree) Indexes
	 		- The most common index type in OLTP-type databases.
	 		- The default index type.
	 		- Can retrieve on or multiple rows.
	 		- Good at retrieving exact match queries or range searches.
	 		- Efficient at DML operations.
	 		- Subtypes of B-TREE Indexes:
	 			* Index-Organized Tables: Store a table in the same way indexes are stored.
	 			* Reverse-key Indexes: The bytes of the indexed column values are stored in
	 			  the index blocks in reverse order.
	 			* Descending Indexes: The values of the indexed column are stored in descending
	 			  order in the index.
	 				CREATE INDEX index_name OM table_name(column_name DESC[ENDING]);
	 			* B-Tree Cluster Indexes: Used with clustered tables.

	 	* BITMAP Indexes
	 		- Create bitmpas for each index key to point to multiple rows.
	 		- Need less storage.
	 		- Are appropiate if most of the column values are duplicates.
	 		- Are more costly in terms of index maintenance.
	 		- Efficient when there are not many DML operations.
	 		- Are extensively used in data warehouses.
	 		- Work faster when there are multiple conditions with the AND and OR operators.
	 		- Can be joined to filter the rows at the index level.
	 		- Bitmap-join Indexes will speed up the joined queries.
	 			- A BITMAP join index is a bitmap index for joining 2 or more tables.

	 	* Function-Based Indexes:
	 		- An index created with a function or expression is considered a function based index.

	 	* Application-Domain Indexes:
	 		- An application domain index is a customized index specific to an application.

	 	* Index Characteristics
	 		- Indexes can be created on one or multiple columns.
	 		- Indexes created on multiple columns are considered Composite Indexes.
	 		- An index can be unique or non-unique.
	 		- Indexes can be created manually or automatically.
	 		- Unique indexes are fastest indexes.
	 			* Non-unique indexes usually work slower than UNIQUE indexes!
	 		- Non-Unique index is the default.
	 		- Bitmap indexes cannot be unique.
	 		- An index can be USABLE or UNUSABLE.
	 		- An index can be VISIBLE or INVISIBLE.
