	 	DROP INDEX index_name [ONLINE];

	 	- To remove an index, we need to have the DROP INDEX privilege or be the owner
	 	  of the index.
	 	- Indexes cannot be modified.
	 	- If we drop a table, all the associated indexes are dropped automatically.
	 	- To allow DML operations while dropping an index, we need to use the ONLINE
	 	  option.
	 	- We cannot drop an index associated with a unique or primary key constraint.
