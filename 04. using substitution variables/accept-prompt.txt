	 Prompting for Values using ACCEPT/PROMPT Commands

	 	* The most reliable and robust method for getting input from the
	 	  user is to explicitly prompt for values using the ACCEPT and 
	 	  PROMPT commands.
	 		- ACCEPT emp_id PROMPT 'Please Enter an Employee ID:';
	 	* The ACCEPT command takes input from the user and stores it in
	 	  a user variable.
	 	* The PROMPT command is used to display a message to the user for
	 	  supplying a brief explanation of what our script is going to
	 	  accomplish.
