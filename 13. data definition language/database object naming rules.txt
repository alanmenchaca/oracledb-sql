	 	* Database object names must follow some standard rules:
	 		1. They should start with a letter.
	 		2. Can contain only A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _, $, and # characters.
	 		3. Can be up to 128 characters in length.
	 		4. Cannot have the same name as another existing object in the same
	 		   schema.
	 		5. Quoted identifiers allow mixed case, but this is not recommended.
	 		6. Cannot be a reserved word like:
	 			- SELECT, FROM, UPDATE, DELETE, WHERE, HAVING, etc.

	 	* Naming Conventions:
	 		1. Table names should be in plural form. (employees, departments, etc.)
	 		2. If a table name has more than one word, they should be separated by
	 		   an underscore.
	 			- user_roles, message_details, etc.
	 		3. Column names should inlcude the alias of the related table underscore
	 		   the column name.
	 		   	- adr_street, usr_first_name, etc.
	 		4. Column names should be singular.
	 			- emp_first_name, emp_last_name, etc.
	 		5. The primary key column names should end with "_ID".
	 			- usr_id, adr_id, emp_id, etc.
	 		6. The logical aliases of both tables should be used while naming a
	 		   foreign key column.
