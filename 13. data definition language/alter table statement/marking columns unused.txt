	 	* The SET UNUSED clause is used to mark one or more columns as unused.
		* As soon as columns are marked as unused, those columns are dropped
		  logically by becoming invisible and inaccessible.
		* During the off-peak hours, the unused columns can be dropped physically
		  as well.

		ALTER TABLE table_name SET UNUSED (column_1[, column_2, ...]);
		ALTER TABLE table_name SET UNUSED COLUMN column_name;

		* The ONLINE keyword at the end of the SET UNUSED clause can be used to
		  indicate that DML operations are allowed on the table while marking
		  columns as unused.

		 ALTER TABLE table_name SET UNUSED (column_1[, column_2, ...]) ONLINE;
