	 	* Read-only means allowing users to read, but not modify, data.
	 	* We need to do maintenance on some tables. During these times, we may
	 	  want to prevent any DML operations and certain DDL statements that
	 	  affect the data on those tables against any accidental changes.

	 	* Oracle allow us to create such tables using the "READ-ONLY" feature.
	 	* The READ ONLY clause is used at the end of the ALTER TABLE syntax to
	 	  set a table to read-only.

	 	ALTER TABLE table_name READ ONLY;

	 	* To change a read-only table to read-write again, the READ WRITE clause
	 	  is used at the end of the ALTER TABLE statement.

	 	ALTER TABLE table_name READ WRITE;
