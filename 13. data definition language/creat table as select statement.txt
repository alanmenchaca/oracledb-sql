	 	* A table can be created using queries and populated with the rows
	 	  returned by the specified query.
	 	CREATE TABLE table_name[(column_1, column_2, ...)] AS select_query;


	 	* A table can be copied with all its table structure and its data.
	 	CREATE TABLE employees_copy AS SELECT * FROM employees;


	 	* A table's structure can be copied without any data.
		CREATE TABLE employees_copy AS (SELECT * FROM employees WHERE 1=2);


		* A table can be created by copying some specific data from another
		  table.
		CREATE TABLE employees_copy
		AS (SELECT * FROM employees WHERE job_id = 'IT_PROG');


		* A table can be created from another table, using only some of the
		  columns.
		CREATE TABLE employees_copy
		AS SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees;


		* Column names can be defined differently from the SELECT list while
		  creating a table.
		CREATE TABLE employees_copy
		AS SELECT first_name f_name, last_name l_name, salary FROM employees;

		CREATE TABLE employees_copy(name, surname, annual_salary)
		AS SELECT first_name, last_name, (salary * 12) FROM employees;


		* The number of specified columns must match with the number of columns
		  in the SELECT list.
		CREATE TABLE employees_copy(name, surname)
		AS SELECT first_name, last_name, (salary * 12) FROM employees;


		Important: While creating a table from a SELECT query, the only
		constraints that are inherited are the NOT NULL constraints.
