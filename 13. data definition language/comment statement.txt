	 	* Oracle provides the COMMENT statement to add an explanation to a
	 	  table or a column.
	 	* We can add a comment to a column of a table.

	 	COMMENT ON COLUMN employees.job_id 
	 		IS 'This column stores abbreviations of job titles.';

	 	* We can add a comment to a table itself.

	 	COMMENT ON TABLE employees
	 		IS 'This table stores all employee data of the company.'

	 	* We cannot directly drop a comment, instead, we create a new comment
	 	  with no text.

	 	COMMENT ON COLUMN employees_copy.job_id IS '';
	 	COMMENT ON TABLE employees_copy IS '';

	 	* We can query the comments from the views: 
	 		- user_tab_comments
	 		- user_col_comments
