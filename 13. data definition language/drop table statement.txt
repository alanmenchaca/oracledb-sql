	 	* The DROP TABLE statement removes an existing table with all its data
	 	  from the database and moves it to the recycle bin.

	 	DROP TABLE table_name [PURGE];

	 	* The "PURGE" option in the "DROP TABLE" statement in Oracle SQL is used
	 	  to remove a table and its associated schema objects entirely from the
	 	  database, including all data and the table structure.
	 	* After dropping a table, we can restore it for a short time using the
	 	  FLASHBACK TABLE statement.

	 	FLASHBACK TABLE table_name TO BEFORE DROP;

	 	* Only the creator of the table or any user who has the "DROP ANY TABLE"
	 	  privilege can drop a table.
	 	* After dropping a table, all the objects related to that table will also
	 	  be deleted or become invalid.
