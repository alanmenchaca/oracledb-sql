	 	* The DELETE statement deletes all data row by row whereas TRUNCATE
	 	  statement deletes all rows from a table more quickly.

	 	TRUNCATE TABLE [schema_name.]table_name;

	 	* The TRUNCATE statement is one of the DDL (Data Definition Language)
	 	  statements so it will auto-commit changes immediately after removing
	 	  data.
	 	* TRUNCATE does not allow rollback.
	 	* The data deleted using the TRUNCATE statement cannot easily be restored
	 	  (FLASHBACK) because TRUNCATE does not generate any undo information or
	 	  log data.
	 	* The TRUNCATE statement works faster than the DELETE statement.
	 	* We need to have the "DROP ANY TABLE" privilege to truncate a table.
