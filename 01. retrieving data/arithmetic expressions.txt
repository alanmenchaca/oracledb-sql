	 	* Arithmetic expressions are used to perform arithmetic operations in SQL.
	 	* An Arithmetic expression can contain column names, numeric numbers, 
	 	  and arithmetic operators.
	 		- Addition (+)
	 		- Substraction (-)
	 		- Multiplication (*)
	 		- Division (/)
	 	* Multiplication and division operations are performed before the addition
	 	  and substraction operations.
	 	* Parentheses has the highest precedence.
	 	* Using parentheses increases the readability of the code.
	 		- SELECT employee_id, salary, salary+50*12 AS "Annual Salary" FROM
	 		  employees;

	
	 ~ Arithmetic Expressions and NULL Values ~
	 	* Arithmetic operations with date values return new date values.
	 		- For example:
	 		We can also perform arithmetic operations by using dates and numbers
	 		together.
	 		- SELECT sysdate + 3 FROM dual; -- Three days after today.
