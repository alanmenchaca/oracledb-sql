	 	* A synonym is a database object created to give an alternative name to another
	 	  database object.
	 	* We can think of synonyms simply as an alias.
	 	* Advantages of Synonyms:
	 		- Useful for hiding the identity and location of the related object.
	 		- Eliminate the need of typing the owner of an object.
	 		- Useful to simplifying (abbreviating) object names.

	 		- Useful for backward compatibility.
	 		- Helpful in moving the objects between schemas without breaking the
	 		  existing code.
	 		- No need for additional privileges for the synonyms.
	 		- Require no storage in the database other than its definition in the data
	 		  dictionary views.
