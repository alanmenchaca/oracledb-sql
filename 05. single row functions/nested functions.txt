		* Character functions take in character data as input and return
		* Functions can be nested within each other. This is called Nesting Functions.
			- Nested Functions = Nesting Functions
		* Nest functions are evaluated starting from the innermost function and
		  executed one by one toward the outermost one.
		  	- function1(function2(function3()))
		* We can use as many nested functions as we want
