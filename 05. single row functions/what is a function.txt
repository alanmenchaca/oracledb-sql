		* Functions are created for manipulating the data and returning a
		  value.
		* Functions must be created before calling them. Otherwise, we will
		  have the following error:
		  	- Function has not been defined yet!
		Functions are formerly created codes that resides in the database.
		They can be called easily by typing only their names and parameters. 
		* A function is a bunch of code created for reuse.
			- Functions are also called as Stored Functions.
		* There are two types of functions:
			1. Single-Row Functions
			2. Multiple-Row Functions (also called Group Functions)
		* Calling a function:
			- function_name[(args1, args2, ...)]


	 ~ Single-Row Functions ~
		* The single row functions operate on single rows and return only one
		  result per row.
		* Accept one or more arguments and return one value.
		* Return value for each row returned. 
		* Can be used alone or nested.
			- function1(function2(function3(x)))
		* A column or an expression can be used as arguments.
		* The returning data type can be different than the input data types. 
			- note: The type of output needs to be certain!
		* Can be used in SELECT, WHERE or ORDER BY clauses.
			- SELECT function_name
		* Single-Row Functions:
			- Numeric, Date, Conversion, General, Character

	-- Overview of Single-Row Functions --
		- Functions are categorized by the data types of their input parameters.
			* Character Functions: Accept character values as input, and return
			  character or numeric values.
			* Number Functions: Accept numeric values as input and return numeric
			  values as output.
			* Date Functions: Operate on values of the DATE data type.
			* Conversion Functions: Used to convert one data type to another.
			* General Functions: These functions take in any data type. But, they
			  are mainly used to handle the NULL values.
