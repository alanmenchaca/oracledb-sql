		- DATE is the main datatype used in Oracle for storing the date values.
		- Oracle Database stores the date values in an internal numeric format.
		- It stores a seven-byte number that contains the century, year, month,
		  day, and hour, minute, and second.
		- There are many different date representations in Oracle like:
			* ('DD-MON-RR', 'DD-MM-YY', 'DD/MM/YYYY', etc.)
		- The RR date format is a different time format element that allows us
		  to show 20th-century dates in the 21st century using only 2 digits.
