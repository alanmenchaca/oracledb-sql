	 	* The syntax for changing a user's password in Oracle is:
	 		ALTER USER user_name IDENTIFIED BY password;
	 		ALTER USER user_name IDENTIFIED BY new_password REPLACE old_password;
	 	* Standard users cannot change other users' passwords.
	 	- DBAs can change every password.

	 	* If we get an invalid username/password error or don't remember the password,
	 	  we can connect as the SYS or SYSTEM users change our password easily.
