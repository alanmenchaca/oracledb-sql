	 	* A system privilege is the right to perform a particular action on the
	 	  database system.
	 	* To grant a system privilege, we need one of the following:
	 		- Need to be granted that system privilege with ADMIN OPTION.
	 		- Need to have GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE.
	 	* SYSTEM_PRIVILEGE_MAP lists all system privileges.
	 	* The DBA role has many system privileges.
	 	* The user who gets the privilege is called the Grantee.
	 		GRANT system_privilege[, system_privilege[, ...]] | [ALL PRIVILEGES]
	 		TO [user | role | PUBLIC][, user | role[, ...]]
	 		[WITH ADMIN OPTION]
	 		[CONTAINER = {CURRENT | ALL}];
	 	* PUBLIC is a special role every user has by default.
	 	* USER_SYS_PRIVS lists all the system privileges that a user has.
	 	* SESSION_PRIVS lists all the system privileges that a user has
	 	  for that session.

	 	~ System privileges should be granted only to trusted users!
	 	~ The WITH ADMIN OPTION is used only for system privileges!

		 	
	 ~ System Privileges ~
		* SYSDBA and SYSOPER are special administrative privileges to perform
		  high-level database administration tasks.
		* SYSDBA gives full control over the database. It allows users to:
			- Create, Drop, and Alter the database.
			- Startup and shutdown the database.
			- Access all data dictionary view, v$ views and x$ structures, etc.
		* SYSOPER allows a user to perform basic operational tasks but without the
		  ability to look athe user data.
			- Startup and shutdown the database.
			- Alter the database for open, mount, backup, etc.
		* These privileges allow users to access the database even when it is not open.
		~ SYS connects as SYSDBA and PUBLIC connects as SYSOPER administrative privileges
		  by default.
