	 	REVOKE privilege[, privilege[, ...]] | ALL [PRIVILEGES]
	 	FROM {user | role | PUBLIC}[, {user | role}[, ...]]
	 	[CONTAINER={CURRENT | ALL}];

	 	* To revoke a system privilege from a user or role, we must have been granted
	 	  the privilege WITH ADMIN OPTION, or have the GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE system privilege.
	 	* A system privilege cannot appear more than once in the list of privileges to be
	 	  revoked.
	 	
	 	REVOKE role[, role[, ...]] 
	 	FROM {user|role|PUBLIC}[, {user|role}[, ...]]
	 	[CONTAINER={CURRENT|ALL}];

	 	REVOKE role[, role[, ...]] | ALL
	 	FROM program_unit, [program_unit, [, ...]];

	 	* To revoke a role from a user or role, we must have been granted the role WITH ADMIN
	 	  OPTION, or have the GRANT ANY ROLE system privilege, or it must have been created
	 	  by us.
	 	* To revoke a role from a program unit, we must connect as the SYS user or we must be
	 	  the schema owner of that program unit.
	 	* A role cannot appear more than once in the list of roles to be revoked.


	 ~ Revoking Object Priviles ~
	 	REVOKE privilege[, privilege[, ...]] | ALL [PRIVILEGES] ON object_name
	 	FROM {user | role | PUBLIC}[, {user | role}[, ...]]
	 	[{CASCADE CONSTRAINTS | FORCE}]
	 	[CONTAINER={CURRENT | ALL}];

	 	* Using the CASCADE CONSTRAINTS clause while revoking the REFERENCES privilege revokes
	 	  all the foreign key constraints referencing the related table.
	 	* We use the FORCE keyword to revoke the EXECUTE object privilege on user-defined type
	 	  objects with table or type dependencies.
	 	* To revoke an object privilege, we must have been granted the privilege WITH GRANT OPTION
	 	  or the GRANT ANY OBJECT PRIVILEGE system privilege, or we need to be the owner of that
	 	  object.
	 	* The program units will be invalid when the privileges of an object referenced by that
	 	  program unit are revoked from the program unit owner.
	 	* Revoking an object privilege from a user will automatically revoke that privilege from
	 	  all the users and roles which are granted by that user.
