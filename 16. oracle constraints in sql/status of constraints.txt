	 	* The ENABLE keywords ensures that all existing and new data must meet the
	 	  constraint conditions.
	 	* The DISABLE keyword allow us to enter new values whether they meet the
	 	  constraint conditions or not.
	 	* VALIDATE or NOVALIDATE can also be used with ENABLE and DISABLE for configuring
	 	  exisiting or future data validation.
	 		- The VALIDATE keyword ensures that the existing data must conform to the
	 		  constraint conditions.
	 		- The NOVALIDATE keyword is used to suspend the checking of existing rows
	 		  for constraint violations.

	 	* A constraint can have four states below:
	 		1. ENABLE VALIDATE: This is the default for the ENABLE clause. All the existing
	 		   rows are checked for whether they conform to the constraint rules, plus, all
	 		   future rows that will be added or modified will be checked while making inserts
	 		   or updates.
	 			- ENABLE = ENABLE VALIDATE
	 		2. ENABLE NOVALIDATE: The existing rows will not be checked. Only the new rows will
	 		   be checked.
	 		3. DISABLE VALIDATE: The constraint is disabled, but it remains valid. No DML
	 		   operations are allowed on the table because the future changes will not be
	 		   validated.
	 		4. DISABLE NOVALIDATE: This is the default for the DISABLE clause. No checks are
	 		   performed on existing and future data.
	 			- DISABLE = DISABLE NOVALIDATE

	 		ALTER TABLE employees_emp ENABLE NOVALIDATE CONSTRAINT emp_tmp_email_uk;
	 		ALTER TABLE employees_emp DISABLE VALIDATE CONSTRAINT emp_tmp_email_uk;
