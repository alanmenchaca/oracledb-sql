	 	* A CHECK constraint ensures a column or a group of columns meets a specific
	 	  condition.
	 	* We can use check constraints in arithmetic operations or conditional operations.
	 	* We cannot create check constraints referencing another table.
	 	* A CHECK constraint can be created at the column-level or table-level.
	 	* A table, even a single column, can have more than one check contraint on it.
