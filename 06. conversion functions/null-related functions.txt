		* NVL Function:
			- NVL(Expression1, Expression2)
			- If expression1 is not null, then NVL() function returns expression1.
			- If expression1 is null, then NVL() function returns expression2.
			- Data types can be characters, numbers or dates.
			- Data types must be match with each other (number-number, date-date, ...).
			- The NVL function is extremely useful in arithmetic operations to avoid
			  calculation errors.
				* SELECT job_id, first_name, last_name, commission_pct,
				  	NVL(commission_pct, 0) AS NVL_COMM_PCT FROM employees
				  	WHERE job_id IN('SA_REP', 'IT_PROG');

		* NVL2 Function:
			- The NVL2 functions allow us replace a value when a null value is
			  encountered as well as when a non-null value is encountered.
			- NVL2(Expression1, Expression2, Expression3)
			- If the Expression1 is not null, then, it returns the Expression2. If the
			  Expression1 is NULL, then, the Expression3 is returned.
			- And the Expression1 does not have the same data type in Expression2 and
			  Expression3. But, the Expression2 and Expression3 must be in the same
			  data type.
			- Data types can be the characters, numbers or dates.
				- SELECT job_id, first_name, last_name, commission_pct,
				  	NVL2(commission_pct, 'has', 'has not') AS "NVL2 EXAMPLE"
				  	FROM employees WHERE job_id IN('SA_REP', 'IT_PROG')
				  	ORDER BY commission_pct NULLS LAST;

		* NULLIF Function:
			- NULLIF(Expression1, Expression2)
			- Compares Expression1 and Expression2. If they are equal, returns NULL.
			  But, if they are not equal, returns Expression1.
			- The Expression1 and Expression2 must be in the same data type.
				- SELECT first_name, last_name, LENGTH(first_name) AS "LEN2",
				  NULLIF(LENGTH(first_name), LENGTH(last_name)) AS "RESULT"
				  FROM employees;

		* COALESCE Function:
			- The COALESCE function accepts a list of arguments and returns the first
			  one that evaluates to a non-null value.
			- COALESCE(Expression1, Expression2, ..., ExpresionN)
			- It accepts at least two or more parameters.
			- If all the specified expressions are NULL, then the function returns NULL.
			- All of the expressions must be in the same data type.
