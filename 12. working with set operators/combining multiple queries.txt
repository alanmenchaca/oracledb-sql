	 	* Multiple queries can be combined with the SET operators.
	 	* SET operators can be different than each other.
	 	* ALL SET operators have equal precedence. 
	 	* Queries are evaluated from top to bottom (left to right).

	 	SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM employees
		UNION ALL
		SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM employees
		    WHERE department_id = 30
		UNION
		SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM retired_employees
		ORDER BY salary;

		SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM employees
		MINUS
		SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM employees
		    WHERE department_id = 30
		INTERSECT
		SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, department_id FROM retired_employees
		ORDER BY salary;

		* [NOTE]: To comply with emerging SQL standards, a future release of Oracle 
		  will give the INTERSECT operator greater precedence than the other set opterators. Therefore, you should use parentheses to specify order of 
		  evaluation in queries that use the INTERSECT operator with other set 
		  operators.
