	 *** UNION Operator ***
	 	* Combine the results of two or more SELECT statements by eliminating
	 	  duplicated rows.

	 	SELECT * FROM retired_employees
		UNION
		SELECT * FROM employees
		WHERE job_id = 'IT_PROG';

	 	SELECT job_id FROM job_history
	 	UNION
	 	SELECT job_id FROM employees WHERE department_id = 80;

	 *** UNION ALL Operator ***
	 	* The UNION is usually slower than UNION ALL!

	 	SELECT job_id FROM job_history
	 	UNION ALL
	 	SELECT job_id FROM employees WHERE department_id = 80;
