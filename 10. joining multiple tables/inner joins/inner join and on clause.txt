		* Returns all the rows from both the participating tables that satisfy
		  the join condition or the expression of the ON/USING clause.
		* In the Inner Joins, unmatched rows do not appear in the result set.

		SELECT columns FROM table1 [INNER] JOIN table2
		ON (join_condition) / USING(column_name);

		* With the ON clause, we can write one or more join conditions even if
		  they have different names. Only the rows that satisfy these join conditions
		  are included in the result set.

		SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.manager_id, d.department_name
		FROM employees e JOIN departments d
		ON (e.department_id = d.department_id AND e.manager_id = d.manager_id);
