		* source_table and target_table
			- SELECT * FROM source_table NATURAL JOIN target_table;
		* Implicitly joins two tables based on common columns that have the 
		  same name and same data type.
		* The rows are matched with each other from two tables that have equal
		  values in the common columns.
		* If common columns have the same name but different type of data, it
		  will result in an error.
		* The WHERE clause can be used to restrict data.

		SELECT columns FROM table NATURAL JOIN table2;
		SELECT * FROM employees NATURAL JOIN departments;

		* In NATURAL joins, common columns are written just once in the output.
