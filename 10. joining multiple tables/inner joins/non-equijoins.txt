		* If two tables do not match with columns, we can join these tables
		  using the BETWEEN operator, or the comparison operators (<, >, <=, >=, <>).

		SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name j.job_title, e.salary, j.min_salary, j.max_salary,
		FROM employees e JOIN jobs j
		ON e.salary BETWEEN j.min_salary AND j.max_salary.

		SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, j.job_title, e.salary, 
        	   j.min_salary, j.max_salary
		FROM employees e JOIN jobs j
		ON e.salary BETWEEN j.min_salary AND j.max_salary;

		* Non-Equijoins Sample Usages:
			- Checking for duplicates
			- Matching against a range of values
			- Computing running totals
