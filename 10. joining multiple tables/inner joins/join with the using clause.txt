		* When joining two tables, if there are more than one common columns
		  that have the same names, we can use the USING clause to specify wich
		  column need to be selected as the join column in the join operation.
		* The USING clause is used for matching a specific column or columns
		  when joining two tables.
		* Joining with the USING clause is considered as "Equijoin".

		SELECT first_name, last_name, departments_name, department_id
		FROM employees JOIN departments USING (department_id);

		
	 ~ Handling Ambiguous Column Names ~
		* Table aliases are used for handling column ambiguity when joining
		  two or more tables.
		* We can explain to the SQL engine which table's column will be used
		  by writing the table aliases.
		* Table aliases increase code readability and query performance.
