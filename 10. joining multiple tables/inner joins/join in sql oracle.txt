		* A join is a concept that allows us to retrieve data from two or more
		  tables in a single query.
		* In SQL, we often need to write queries to get data from two or more
		  tables. Anything but the simplest of queries will usually need data
		  from two or more tables, and to get data from multiple tables, we need
		  to use the joins.
		* Joining tables does not change the actual data in the tables.
	
	
	 ~ Creating a Join ~
		* SELECT columns FROM table1 JOIN_TYPE table2 
		  ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
