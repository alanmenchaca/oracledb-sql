	 	* All the join types performed with the ANSI syntax can be done with
	 	  Oracle's old join syntax.
	 	* We should always use the ANSI standard syntax.
	 		1. The ANSI syntax is easier to read.
	 		2. Old syntax is more likely to return unintentional data or
	 		   cartesian product.
	 		3. There is no difference in performance.
	 		4. The outer join operator with the old syntax can be on one side
	 		   of a join condition.
	 			* SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
	 			  FROM employees e, departments d
	 			  WHERE e.department_id(+) = d.department_id
	 			  UNION
	 			  SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
	 			  FROM employees e, departments d
	 			  WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id(+);
	 		5. A join condition containing the outer join operator (+) cannot
	 		   use the IN operator.
	 		   	* This rule is valid until the Oracle database version 10g!
	 		6. A join condition containing the outer join operator (+) cannot
	 		   be combined with another condition using the OR operator.
	 		7. A join condition containing the join operator cannot involve a
	 		   subquery.
	 		8. The join operator need to be written for all the conditions that
	 		   the table has.
