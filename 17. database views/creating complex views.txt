	 	* Can retrieve data from one or more tables.
	 	* Complex views can contain:
	 		- Functions
	 		- Joins 
	 		- GROUP BY
	 		- DISTINCT
	 		- ROWNUM
	 		- ROWID

	 		CREATE VIEW emp_cx_vw (DNAME, MIN_SAL, MAX_SAL) AS
		    SELECT DISTINCT UPPER(department_name), MIN(salary), MAX(salary)
		    FROM employees e INNER JOIN departments d USING (department_id)
		    GROUP BY department_name;

		* In Simple Views DML Operations are allowed!
		* In Complex Views the Database Server decides if we can do DML operations.
