	 	* A view is a schema object formed of a stored SQL query based on tables or
	 	  other views.
	 		CREATE VIEW view_name AS
	 			SELECT DISTINCT UPPER(department_name) dept_name,
	 				MIN(salary) min_sal, 
	 				MAX(salary) max_sal
	 			FROM employees e INNER JOIN departments d USING (department_id)
	 			GROUP BY department_name
	 			ORDER BY dept_name;

	 	* A view is stored in the database as a SELECT statement.
	 	* No data is stored in views.
	 	* The tables that views are based on are called base tables.
	 	* Views are used for:
	 		- Restricting data access
	 		- Simplifying data retrieval
	 		- Presenting different views of the same data
	 		- Providing logical data independence

	 	
	 ~ View Types ~
	 	* Simple Views: Views that retrieve data from one table, containing no functions
	 	  and no grouping data.
	 	* Complex Views: Views that retrieve data from more than one table, or contain 
	 	  functions or grouping of data.
