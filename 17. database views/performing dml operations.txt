	 	* Simple views allow DML operations
	 	* Complex views restrict DML operations based on how they were created.
	 		- Any DML operations are not allowed on a complex view!
	 	* Performing DML operations using views is not the best practice.

		 	-- DML operations with Complex Views
			CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW emp_vw_60 AS
			    SELECT DISTINCT employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, 
			                    hire_date, job_id, department_id
			    FROM employees_copy 
			    WHERE department_id = 60;

			-- SQL Error: ORA-01732: data manipulation operation not legal on this view
			-- Complex views restrict DML operations based on how they were created.
			INSERT INTO emp_vw_60 
			    VALUES (214, 'Alex', 'Hummel', 'AHUMMEL', sysdate, 'IT_PROG', 60);
			UPDATE emp_vw_60 SET job_id = 'SA_MAN' WHERE employee_id = 214;
			DELETE FROM emp_vw_60;
