	 	* A view can be removed by using the DROP VIEW statements.
	 	* Dropping a view doesn't cause data loss on the base tables.
	 	* Dropping a view means deleting its definition from the database.
	 	* Dropping a view invalidates all the objects based on this view.
	 		- For example if we use the emp_vw_50 in something like a trigger
	 		 or a PL/SQL Package those objects will become invalid. 
	 	* To drop a view, we need to be the owner of this view or have the
	 	  DROP ANY VIEW privilege.
	 		DROP VIEW view_name;
