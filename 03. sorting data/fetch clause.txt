	 	* The FETCH clause is used in conjunction with the SELECT and ORDER BY
	 	  clauses to limit the rows and retrieve a portion
	 	  of the returning rows.

	 	  	- [OFFSET rows_to_skip ROW[S]] FETCH [FIRST|NEXT]
	 	  	  	[row_count | percent PERCENT] ROW[S] [ONLY | WITH TIES];
	 	  		* OFFSET -> Specifies the number of rows to skip before the row
	 	  		  limiting starts.
	 	  		* ROW|ROWS -> Both of them can be used based on the returning
	 	  		  rows in order to increase the semantic clarity.
	 	  		* FETCH -> Specifies the number of rows or percentage of rows
	 	  		  to return.
	 	  		* FIRST|NEXT -> We can use any of them based on the situation.
	 	  		* row_count|percent PERCENT -> The row_count to specify the
	 	  		  number of rows to return, the PERCENT specifies the
	 	  		  percentage of the total number of selected rows to return.
	 	  		* ONLY|WITH TIES -> ONLY is used to return exactly the specified
	 	  		  number of rows or percentage of rows. The WITH TIES returns
	 	  		  extra rows with the same value as the last row fetched. If we
	 	  		  specified WITH TIES, then we must specify the order_by_clause.
	 	  		  If we do not specify the ORDER BY clause, then, no additional
	 	  		  rows will be returned.

	 	    - SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees
			    ORDER BY salary DESC 
			    OFFSET 1 ROW FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS WITH TIES;
	 	  	- SELECT order_id, order_total, customer_id FROM orders
				ORDER BY order_total DESC 
				OFFSET 10 ROWS FETCH NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY; 

	 	  	- SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees
    			OFFSET 10 ROWS;	
			- SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees
    			ORDER BY salary DESC FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;
