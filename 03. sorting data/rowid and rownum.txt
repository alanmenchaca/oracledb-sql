	 	* The ROWID is a unique identifier that contains the physical
	 	  addres of a row.
	 	* The ROWID is a unique identity for each record, the ROWID
	 	  does not change.
	 		- Oracle automatically generates a unique ROWID at the
	 		  time of insertion of a row.
	 		- The fastest way to access a single row is using its ROWID.
	 		- The ROWID is permanent.
	 		- The ROWID doesn't change.
	 	* The ROWNUM is nothing but consecutive logical sequence number
	      given to the rows fetched from the table.
	 		- To limit the returning rows in a table, we can use the 
	 		  ROWNUM pseudo column.
	 		- The ROWNUM is temporary.
	 		- If we change the query, the ROWNUM number will refer to 
	 		  another row.
	 		- We can think of the ROWNUM values like the row numbers
	 		  in an Excel Spreadsheet.
