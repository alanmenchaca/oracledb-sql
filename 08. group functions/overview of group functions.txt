		- Group Functions are used to manipulate multiple rows and return one value.
		- The NULL values are ignored by default.
		- The DISTINCT operator can be used to eliminate duplicate rows to work with
		  the unique values.
		- Multiple group functions can be used in a single query.
		- SELECT MIN(salary), MAX(hire_date), AVG(salary), COUNT(*),
			LISTAGG(DISTINCT job_id, ', ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY job_id DESC)
		  FROM employees;
