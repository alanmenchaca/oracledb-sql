		- Returns the number of rows returned by a query.
		- COUNT([DISTINCT|ALL] expression)
		- We can use the DISTINCT keyword to count the distinct values of the
		  expression, or ALL keywords to count all rows.
		- '*' represents all rows including the NULL values -> COUNT(*).
		- If a column name is used with the COUNT function, this time, the NULL
		  values are ignored -> COUNT(salary).
		- We can use the NVL, NVL2, COALESCE, CASE or DECODE function to handle
		  the NULL values.
		- SELECT COUNT(*), COUNT(manager_id), COUNT(ALL manager_id),
		  	COUNT(DISTINCT manager_id) FROM employees;
