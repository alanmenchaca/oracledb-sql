	 	* The LIKE operator are used for searching some texts in
	 	  string values.
	 	* The LIKE operator is used to perform wildcard searches
	 	  and retrieves rows matching a certain character pattern.
	 		- Percentage Sign (%):
	 			- Matches any number of characters including 0 or
	 			  more characters.
	 		- Underscore (_): 
	 			- Matches exactly one character.
	 	* The LIKE operator can also be used without the wildcard
	 	  characters (%, _). But, it is nonsense because it will be
	 	  equal to (=) operator and LIKE is slower than (=) operator.
