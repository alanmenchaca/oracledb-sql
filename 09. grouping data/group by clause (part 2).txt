		- The SELECT clause cannot have any different columns than what is
		  used in the GROUP BY clause.

			* The following statement don't work:
				- SELECT job_id, department_id, AVG(salary)
				  FROM employees
				  GROUP BY department_id
				  ORDER BY AVG(salary);

			* The following statement is correct:
				- SELECT job_id, department_id, AVG(salary)
				  FROM employees
				  GROUP BY department_id, job_id
				  ORDER BY AVG(salary);

		- We don't need to use all the columns used with the GROUP BY clause in
		  the SELECT statement.
			* SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department_id;

		- We can use as many group functions as we want in a SELECT statement while
		  working with the GROUP BY clause.
		 	* SELECT AVG(salary), SUM(salary), MIN(salary), MAX(salary), COUNT(*)
		 	  FROM employees 
		 	  GROUP BY department_id 
		 	  ORDER BY AVG(salary);

		- Column aliases cannot be used with the GROUP BY clause, but they can be 
		  used with the ORDER BY clause.
		    * The following statement don't work:
		  		- SELECT department_id AS Departments, AVG(salary)
		  	  	  FROM employees
		  	  	  GROUP BY Departments
		  	  	  ORDER BY AVG(salary);

		  	* The following statement is correct:
		  		- SELECT department_id AS Departments, AVG(salary)
		  	  	  FROM employees
		  	  	  GROUP BY department_id
		  	  	  ORDER BY Departments;

		  	* The Order of Execution = Query Processing Order

		- We can use the WHERE clause to restrict the resulting data.
			* SELECT job_id, department_id, AVG(salary) FROM employees
			  WHERE job_id IN('ST_MAN', 'SH_CLERK', 'ST_CLERK')
			  GROUP BY job_id, department_id
			  ORDER BY AVG(salary);
