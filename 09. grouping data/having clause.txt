		* The group functions cannot be used in the WHERE clause.
			- SELECT job_id, AVG(salary) FROM employees
			  WHERE AVG(salary) > 5000
			  GROUP BY job_id;
		* We can use the HAVING clause to filter data after it has been grouped.
		* The WHERE clause filters rows whereas the HAVING clause filters grouped data.


		SELECT column_name, group_function
		FROM table
		[WHERE] condition
		[GROUP BY group_by_expression]
		[HAVING group_condition]
		[ORDER BY column];

		SELECT job_id, AVG(salary)
		FROM employees
		GROUP BY job_id
		HAVING AVG(salary) > 5000;

		* The WHERE clause and the HAVING clause can also be used together in a query.
