		- Creates groups of values using the group functions.
			* SELECT expression1, expression2, ..., expression_n,
					 aggregate_function(aggregate_expression)
			  FROM table
			  [WHERE condition] 
			  GROUP BY expression1, expression2, ..., epxression_n
			  [ORDER BY order_expression]
		- We can use more than one expression -or column- in a GROUP BY clause.
		- The SELECT clause cannot have any other individual columns than what
		  is used with the GROUP BY clause.
		- We don't need to use all the columns used with the GROUP BY clause in
		  the SELECT statement.
		- In the SELECT statement, we can use the group functions with different
		  columns than the GROUP BY has.
		- The GROUP BY clause groups the rows(not the columns) considering the
		  columns used with the GROUP BY clause.
		- We can use as many group functions as we want.
		- Column aliases cannot be used with the GROUP BY clause.
		- The ORDER BY clause cannot have any other individual columns than the
		  GROUP BY clause has.
		- We can use the WHERE clause to restrict the resulting data.

		Can we show the average salaries of each job id in a single salary?
			- SELECT job_id, AVG(salary) FROM employees
			  GROUP BY job_id
			  ORDER BY AVG(salary);

		We can use more than one column with the GROUP BY clause.
			- SELECT job_id, department_id, manager_id, AVG(salary)
			  FROM employees
			  GROUP BY department_id, job_id, manager_id;
