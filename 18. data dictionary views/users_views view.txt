	 	* The USER_VIEWS data dictionary view shows the details about the views that the
	 	  user owns.
	 	* When we use a view in a query, Oracle Server:
	 		1. Retrieves thew view text from the USER_VIEWS data dictionary view.
	 		2. Checks if the user has privileges to query from this view.
	 		3. Checks for the privileges of the view owner on the base tables used in
	 		   the view.
	 		4. Executes the view subquery (Retrieves data or makes an update).
	 	* The USER_VIEWS data dictionary views stores metadata of all the views that the
	 	  user has.

	 	  SELECT * FROM user_views;
