	 [INTRODUCTION TO THE ORACLE FLASHBACK TECHNOLOGIES]
	 	* Oracle Flashback feature is data recovery technology that help us to prevent
	 	  data loss.
	 	* If we delete some rows, truncate or drop tables by mistake, we can restore
	 	  them to a specific point in the time or to a state before drop using FLASHBACK
	 	  statement.
	 	* We can restore a table to a certain time, to a restore point, to a System Change
	 	  Number (SCN), or to before drop.
	 	* What is the System Change Number?
	 		- A System Change Number (SCN) is an incremental unique integer value associated
	 		  with each change on the database.
	 		-  Each time a commit is performed for a transaction, the Oracle server automatically
	 		   creates a new system change number.
		* FLASHBACK restores not only the table and its data, but also the associated constraints
		  and indexes related to the dropped table.
	    * Oracle allows us to restore not only the tables, but also a transaction, or the
	      database itself using Flashback statements.
	    * Flashback is extremely useful especially in test databases.
	    * If there is physical damage on the database disks, flashback will not work because it is
	      a logical operation.

	 [USING FLASHBACK STATEMENTS]
	 	* Multiple tables can be flashed back at once.
	 	* While flashing back a table, all the table triggers are disabled. The ENABLE TRIGGERS
	 	  clause will return the triggers enabled.
	 	* To flashback a table, we need to enable row movement!
	 		ALTER TABLE table_name ENABLE ROW MOVEMENT;

	 		FLASHBACK TABLE [schema_name_1.]table_name_1 [,[schema_name_2.]table_name_2, ...]
	 				  TO {{{SCN|TIMESTAMP} expr | RESTORE POINT restore_point}
	 				  {[ENABLE|DISABLE} TRIGGERS] | BEFORE DROP [ RENAME TO table ]};

	 		FLASHBACK TABLE employees_copy TO BEFORE DROP;
	 		FLASHBACK TABLE employees_copy TO SCN 202381;
	 		FLASHBACK TABLE employees_copy TO TIMESTAMP sysdate-1/1440;

	 		CREATE RESTORE POINT salaries_updated;
	 		FLASHBACK TABLE employees_copy TO RESTORE POINT salaries_updated;
