	 	* If you drop a table, all the dropped data (table, index, view, etc.) is stored
	 	  in the RECYCLE BIN.
	 	* The RECYCLE BIN is actually a data dictionary table containing information about
	 	  dropped objects.
	 	* When we flashback a table, related data is stored from the RECYCLE BIN.
	 	* Each user can find their own objects in the RECYCLE BIN even if the user does
	 	  not have SYSDBA privileges.
	 	* If a user has SYSDBA privileges, then this user can see all the data in the
	 	  entire database in the RECYCLE BIN.
	 	* If we dont want a table to be stored in the RECYCLE BIN, we need to drop that
	 	  table with the PURGE option.
			DROP TABLE employees_copy PURGE; 

		* If we want to remove a table from the recycle bin as well, then we can remove
		  that dropped table from the recycle bin by writing:
			PURGE TABLE employees_copy;

		Warning: We can purge the whole RECYCLE BIN by using the following code:
			PURGE RECYCLEBIN;
