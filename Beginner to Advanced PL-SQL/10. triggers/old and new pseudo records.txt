  When a row-level trigger fires, the PL/SQL runtime system creates and
  populates the two pesudo records OLD and NEW.

  * For an INSERT trigger, OLD contains no values, and NEW contains the
    new values.
  * For and UPDATE trigger, OLD contains the old values, and NEW contains
    the new values.
  * For a DELETE trigger, OLD contains the old values, and NEW contains
    no values.

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER customer_after_update_values
AFTER UPDATE ON customer FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
	username VARCHAR2(50);
BEGIN
    -- Find username of person performing INSERT into table
    SELECT user INTO username FROM dual;

	INSERT INTO audit_log (userid, operation_date, b_customerid,
        				   a_customerid, b_firstname, a_firstname)
    VALUES (username, sysdate, :OLD.customer_id, :NEW.customer_id,
        					   :OLD.first_name, :NEW.first_name);
END;


SELECT * FROM audit_log;
SELECT * FROM customer;
UPDATE customer SET first_name = 'Peter'
WHERE first_name = 'PETER';
