	~ Triggers ~
  Triggers are stored programs, which are automatically executed or fired
  when some events occur. Triggers are, in fact, written  to be executed
  in response to any of the following events.

  * A database manipulation (DML) statement (DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE).
  * A database definition (DDL) statement (CREATE, ALTER, or DROP).
  * A database operation (SERVERERROR, LOGON, LOGOFF, STARTUP or
    SHUTDOWN).

  Triggers could be defined on the table, view, schema, or database with
  which the event is associated.
