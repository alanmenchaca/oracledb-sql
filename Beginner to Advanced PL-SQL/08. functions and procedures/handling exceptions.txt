	* Handling the Exceptions in Subprograms
		- We can have an exception section in all begin-end blocks.
		- When an exception is raised, the control is passed to the
		  exception section.
		- We may have exceptions in functions & procedures, too.
		- In subprograms, the unhandled exceptions is raised to the caller.
		- We should handle all the possible exceptions.
