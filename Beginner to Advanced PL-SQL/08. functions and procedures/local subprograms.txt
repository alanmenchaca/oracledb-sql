	*  Local Subprograms
		- We create procedures and functions to reduce the code crowd.
		- They are called as stored procedures & stored functions.
		- Sometimes it is unnecessary to store the subprograms.
		- We can create subprograms inside of an anonymous block or in
		  another subprogram.
		- The benefits of local subprograms:
			* Reduce code repetition
			* Improve code readability
			* Need no more privilege
		- The cons of the local variables:
			* They are accessible only in the bocks they are defined
