	~ Binary Large Objects (CLOB) ~
    - ClOBs can store only character data but BLOBs can store any type
      of data.
    - They are used to hold non-traditional data, such as voice or mixed
      media (images, pdf, documents, videos).
    - Even we can use insert character data into a BLOB, Oracle will store
      it as raw data.
    - This means that we can not use SQL functions line SUBSTR to handle
      BLOB data.

CREATE TABLE job_resumes_blob (
    resume_id NUMBER,
    first_name VARCHAR2(100),
    last_name VARCHAR2(100),
    resume BLOB
);
