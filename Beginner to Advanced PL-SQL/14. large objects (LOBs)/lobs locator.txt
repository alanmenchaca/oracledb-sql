	~ LOB's Locator ~
    - Every LOB is associated with a lob locator.
    - A lob locator is a pointer to the actual location of the LOB value.
    - The locator associated with internal LOBs is called a LOB locator
      while the locator associated with external LOBs is called a BFILE
      locator.
    - When storing data in a LOB column, you are also storing a LOB locator
      with it.
    - This LOB locator is what is returned to you when you select the
      LOB column.
    - The actual LOB value can then be retrieved using this locator.
