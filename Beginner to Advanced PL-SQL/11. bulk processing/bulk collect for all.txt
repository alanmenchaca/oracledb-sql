	~ Bulk Collect and FOR ALL ~
  * Bulk Collect:
  SELECT statements that retrieve multiple rows with a single fetch,
  improving the speed of data retrieval.
  We will use BULK COLLECT fnuctionality to fetch all the ORDER_IDs
  and stoer it in collection.

  * FOR ALL:
  INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs that use collections to change multiple
  rows of data very quickly.

  We will use FOR ALL functionality to update all the rows stored in the
  collection. FOR ALL "bundles up" all the updates and passes them to the
  SQL engine with a single context switch.


CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE update_tax (
    tax_rate IN NUMBER
) AS 
	l_eligible BOOLEAN;
	TYPE order_id_type IS TABLE OF sales.order_id%TYPE 
        INDEX BY PLS_INTEGER;
	l_order_ids order_id_type;
BEGIN
    SELECT DISTINCT order_id BULK COLLECT INTO l_order_ids
    FROM sales;

	FORALL indx IN 1 .. l_order_ids.COUNT
        UPDATE SALES
        SET tax_amount = total_amount + tax_rate
        WHERE order_id = l_order_ids(indx);
END;
