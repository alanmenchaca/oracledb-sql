	~ Bind Variables and Parsing ~
  Each time the query is submitted
  * Oracle first checks in the shared pool to see wether this statement 
    has been submitted before.
  * If it has, the execution plan that this statement previously used is
    retrieved, and the SQL is executed.
  * If the statement cannot be found in the shared pool, Oracle has to go
    through the proccess of parsing the statement, working out the various
    execution paths and coming up with an optimal access plan before it
    can be executed.
  * This process is know as a hard parse and for OLTP applications can
    actually take longer to carry out that the DML instruction itself.

SELECT sales_date, order_id, product_id, customer_id, total_amount
FROM sales WHERE customer_id = 12;
SELECT sales_date, order_id, product_id, customer_id, total_amount
FROM sales WHERE customer_id = 11;
SELECT sales_date, order_id, product_id, customer_id, total_amount
FROM sales WHERE customer_id = 10;

SELECT sales_date, order_id, product_id, customer_id, total_amount
FROM sales WHERE customer_id = :cust_no;

  By using BIND variables, we are using the SQL parsing which was done for
  the 1st time, thus avoiding the Hard Parse every single time you execute
  the procedure.
  This is referred as soft parse.
