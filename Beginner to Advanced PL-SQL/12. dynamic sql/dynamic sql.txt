	~ Dynamic SQL ~
  Dynamic SQL is a programming methodology used in below scenarios:
  * Generating and runnnig SQL statements at run time.
  * It is useful when writing general-purpose and flexible programs
    like ad hoc query systems.
  * When you must run database definition language (DDL) statements
    inside your PL/SQL program.
  * The number or data types of its input and output variables.

  PL/SQL provides two ways to write dynamic SQL
  * Native dynamic SQL, a PL/SQL language feature for building and 
    running dynamic SQL statements.
  * DBMS_SQL package, an API for building, running, and describing 
    dynamic SQL statements.

  The EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement is the means by which native dynamic
  SQL processes most dynamic SQL statements.

  BEGIN
      EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'CREATE TABLE x (a NUMBER)';
  END;

  CREATE PROCEDURE update_customer (
      customer_id_param IN NUMBER
  ) AS
  BEGIN
      EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'UPDATE sales SET total_amount = total_amount * 0.9
			    WHERE customer_id = ' || customer_id_param;
  END;

  EXECUTE update_customer(11);
  SELECT * FROM sales;
