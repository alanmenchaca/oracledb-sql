			- MERGE: It can perform inserts, updates and deletes in one query.

		* DDL: Data Definition Language
		The commands are used to create, modify and drop any of the database objects.
			- CREATE: It is used to create a new table or other  database objects
					  like indexes, views, functions, procedures, triggers, etc.
			- ALTER: It is used to modify the existing database objects, we can
					 change the structure of the database objects in many ways,
					 after we create them.
			- DROP: It's used to remove the objects from the database, if one
					object is removed, the data inside that objects is also removed.
			- RENAME: It's used to rename the database objects, we can change the
					  name of the database objects, with the rename command.

		* TCL: Transaction Control Language
		  TCL commands allow us to control and manage transactions to maintain the
		  integrity of the database (we can thing these statements as saving or
		  canceling the data manipulations).
			- COMMIT: It's used to make the changes permanent on the database.
			- ROLLBACK: Restores the database to last commit state (which means.
			  take the changes back).
