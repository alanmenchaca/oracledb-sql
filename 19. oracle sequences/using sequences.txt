	 	* NEXTVAL: Returns the next value of the sequence.
	 		SELECT employee_seq.nextval FROM dual;
	 	* CURVAL: Returns the current sequence value. 
	 		SELECT employee_seq.currval FROM dual;

	 	!! Before using any sequence, it is mandatory to initialize it first using the
	 	   NEXTVAL keyword!

	 	* If you try to retrieve the current value without initializing it for your session,
	 	  you will get an error. 

	 		-- *Cause: sequence CURRVAL has been selected before sequence NEXTVAL
			SELECT employee_seq.currval FROM dual;

		* NEXTVAL and CURRVAL can be used:
			- In the SELECT list of a query (not in a subquery or a view).
			- In the SELECT list of a subquery in an INSERT statement.
			- In the VALUES part of an INSERT statement.
			- In the SET clause of an UPDATE statement.

			INSERT INTO 
				employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, email, hire_date, salary, job_id) 
				VALUES (employee_seq.nextval, 'Alex', 'Earnst', 
					    'AEARNST', sysdate, '2500', 'IT_PROG');

		* NEXTVAL and CURRVAL cannot be used:
			- With the DISTINCT keyword.
			- In the GROUP BY clause
			- In the HAVING clause.
			- In the ORDER BY clause.
