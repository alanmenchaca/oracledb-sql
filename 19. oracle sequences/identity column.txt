	 	* The IDENTITY column automatically generates and inserts sequential values
	 	  into the related column.
	 		
	 		GENERATED [ ALWAYS | BY DEFAULT [ ON NULL ]] AS IDENTITY [(identity options)]

	 		* GENERATED ALWAYS: Always generates a value on each insert.
	 			- GENERATED ALWAYS is the default option.
	 		* GENERATED BY DEFAULT: Generates a value only if no value is provided.
	 		* GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL: Generates a value if a NULL value or nothing
	 		  is specified.
	 		* Identity options has the same set or properties as a sequence.
	 		* The DROP IDENTITY clause removes the identity property but keeps the
	 		  column.
	 			ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY column_name DROP IDENTITY;
	 		* START WITH LIMIT VALUE sets the existing maximum/minimum value + INCREMENT BY
	 		  as the START WITH value.

	 	* The IDENTITY column restrictions:
	 		- A table can have only one identity column.
	 		- Identity columns must be numeric data types.
	 		- Identity column is not inherited when using a CTAS statement.
	 		- Identity column cannot have another DEFAULT value.
	 		- Identity columns implicitly have NOT NULL and NOT DEFERRABLE constraints.
	 		- The CREATE SEQUENCE privilege is nedded to create an identity column.
	 	* The USER_TAB_IDENTITY_COLS view can be used to query all the identity columns.
	 	* The SYS.IDNSEQ$ view stores the link between the table and the sequence.
