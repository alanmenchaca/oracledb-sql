	 	* A sequence can be modified using the ALTER SEQUENCE statement.

		 	ALTER SEQUENCE sequence_name
		 	| { INCREMENT BY increment_num }
		 	| { MAXVALUE max_num | NOMAXVALUE }
		 	| { MINVALUE min_value | NOMINVALUE }
		 	| { CYCLE | NOCYCLE }
		 	| { CACHE cache_num | NOCACHE }
		 	| { ORDER | NOORDER }
		 	];

		* We must be the owner of the sequence or have the ALTER ANY SEQUENCE privilege to
		  modify a sequence.
		!! Only future sequence numbers are affected.
		* We cannot use the START WITH option while modifying a sequence.
			* We must drop and re-create the sequence to start the sequence from a different
			  number.
		* While modifying sequences, some validations are performed (e.g., MAXVALUE cannot be
		  smaller than the CURRENT value).   

			ALTER SEQUENCE employee_seq
			INCREMENT BY 5
			MAXVALUE 99999
			CACHE 30
			NOCYCLE;
		
		* Parameters not defined in the ALTER SEQUENCE statement, will remain the same.
