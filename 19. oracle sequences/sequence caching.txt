	 	* Sequences can be cached in memory to improve performance.
	 	* Cache size can be defined when the sequence is initially created or altered
	 	  (Default: 20).
	 	* The specified number of sequence values is cached into memory on the first call.
	 	* Sequence values are retrieved from the cache on request. 
	 	* After the last cached sequence value in memory is used, the next set of sequence
	 	  values is cached.
	 	* Cashed sequence values will be lost on any system failure, even if we haven't
	 	  used them all.
