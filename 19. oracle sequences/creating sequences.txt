	 	* START WITH: First sequence number to be generated. (Default 1)
	 	* INCREMENT BY: Interval between sequence numbers. (Default 1) 
	 	* MAXVALUE: Maximum value that the sequence can generate.
	 		- NOMAXVALUE: Generates sequence values until it reaches 10^28-1
	 	* MINVALUE: Minimum value that the sequence can generate. 
	 		- NOMINVALUE: Generates sequence values until it reaches -10^27+1
	 	* CYCLE: After reaching its maximum or minimum value, the sequence continues to
	 	  generate numbers starting with the minimum value.
	 		- NOCYCLE: Stops generating numbers after reaching the maximum value. (By
	 		  default NOCYCLE is set.)
	 	* CACHE: Specifies how many values are prellocated in memory by the Oracle Server. 
	 		- NOCACHE: No value is kept in memory.
	 	* ORDER: Guarantees that sequence numbers are generated in order of request.
	 		- NOORDER: If you do not need to ensure that Oracle generates sequence
	 		  numbers in order of request, NOORDER can be used.
