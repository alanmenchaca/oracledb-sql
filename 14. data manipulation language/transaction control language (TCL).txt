	 	* Oracle implements the concept of a transaction like most databases.
	 	* What is a Transaction?
	 		- A transaction is a unit of work that you want to treat as "a whole".
	 		  It has to either happen in full or not at all.
	 	* Transactions are used to ensure data integrity, data consistency and
	 	  data security.
	 	* A transaction starts with the first execution of DML statements and finishes
	 	  with any commit, rollback or system failure, or the DLL or DCL statements.
	 	* When we execute a DML operation, the affected rows are locked and no one
	 	  else can update or delete these rows during this lock.
	 	* There are 3 types of Transaction Control Statements:
	 		1. Commit
	 		2. Rollback
	 		3. Savepoint
