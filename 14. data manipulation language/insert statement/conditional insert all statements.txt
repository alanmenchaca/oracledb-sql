	 ~ Multitable Insert Statements ~
	 [CONDITIONAL INSERT ALL Statement]

	 	* Conditional INSERT ALL statements allow us to insert rows into the related
	 	  tables in one step based on the specified conditions.
	 	* Conditions are specified between the WHEN-THEN keywords.

		 	INSERT ALL
		 		WHEN condition_1 THEN
		 			INTO insert_statement_1;
		 			INTO insert_statement_2;
		 			...
		 		WHEN condition_2 THEN
		 			INTO insert_statement_3;
		 			...
		 		ELSE
		 			INTO insert_statement_n;
		 	subquery;

	 	* Conditions are specified between the WHEN-THEN keywords.
	 	* Conditional expressions, even a subquery, which evaluate to true or
	 	  false can be written between the WHEN-THEN keywords.
	 	* In conditional INSERT ALL statements, all WHEN conditions are evaluated
	 	  regardless of of the results of any other WHEN clause.
