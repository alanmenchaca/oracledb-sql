	 	* We can build IF-THEN-ELSE logic using the INSERT FIRST statement.
	 	* When we specify INSERT FIRST instead of INSERT ALL, then, the database 
	 	  evaluates each WHEN clause in the order in which it appears in the statement.
	 	* For the first WHEN clause that evaluates to true, the database executes the
	 	  corresponding INTO clause and skips subsequent WHEN clauses for the given row.
	 	* If the first condition is satisfied, then, it stops checking. If not, it
	 	  continues until one is satisfied or it reaches the ELSE statement.

		 		WHEN condition_1 THEN
		 			INTO insert_statement_1;
		 			INTO insert_statement_2;
		 			...
		 		WHEN condition_2 THEN
		 			INTO insert_statement_3;
		 			...
		 		ELSE
		 			INTO insert_statement_n;
		 	subquery;

		 	INSERT FIRST
		 		WHEN salary < 5000 THEN
		 			INTO low_salaries VALUES(employee_id, department_id, salary)
		 		WHEN salary BETWEEN 5000 AND 10000 THEN
		 			INTO avg_salaries VALUES(employee_id, department_id, salary)
		 		ELSE
		 			INTO high_salaries VALUES(employee_id, department_id, salary)
		 	SELECT * FROM employees;
