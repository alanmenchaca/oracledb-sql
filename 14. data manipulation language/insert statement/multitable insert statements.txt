	 ~ Multitable Insert Statements ~
	 	* Multiple rows can be inserted into a table or multiple tables by using only
	 	  one SQL statement instead of writing several INSERT statements.
		* The INSERT ALL statement is used to insert multiple rows into a table or
		  multiple tables.
		* Multitable insert statements increase performance and save time.
		* If you don't use multi-inserts, inserting lots of rows may take considerable
		  time as each INSERT statement is processed individually.
		* Multitable inserts are generally used in data warehousing (DWH).
