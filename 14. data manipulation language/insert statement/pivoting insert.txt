	 	* Pivoting insert is used for converting non-relational data to a relational
	 	  format and inserting it into a relational table.
	 	* An Unconditional INSERT ALL statement can also be used for pivoting data.

		 	INSERT ALL
		 		INTO emp_sales_normalized VALUES(employee_id, week_id, sales_mon, 'MON')
		 		INTO emp_sales_normalized VALUES(employee_id, week_id, sales_tue, 'TUE')
		 		INTO emp_sales_normalized VALUES(employee_id, week_id, sales_wed, 'WED')
		 		INTO emp_sales_normalized VALUES(employee_id, week_id, sales_thu, 'THU')
		 		INTO emp_sales_normalized VALUES(employee_id, week_id, sales_fri, 'FRI')
	 		SELECT * FROM emp_sales;

	 	* The order of execution is not guaranteed in the INSERT ALL statements.
