 	
	 ~ COMMIT and ROLLBACK statements ~
	 	* Rollback: Undoes any changes made to the database and restores data to
	 	  its previous state.
	 	* Commit: Permanently saves the changes into the database and ends the
	 	  transaction.
	 	* A transaction will end when any commit or rollback statements are encountered.
	 	* Before commit or rollback operations, you can only see the changes in your own
	 	  session, but no one else can see them in their sessions.
	 	* After committing any DML operations, everyone will be able to see the changes
	 	  as they will be permanent.
	 	* After commit or rollback operations, all the locked rows are released and
	 	  everyone can change these rows.
	 	* After a Data Definition Language (DDL) or Data Control Language (DCL) statement,
	 	  the commit will be automatically executed.
