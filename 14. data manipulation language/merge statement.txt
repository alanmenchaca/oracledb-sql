	 	* The MERGE statement is used to INSERT new records, UPDATE or DELETE existing
	 	  ones depending on the specified conditions at the same time.
	 	* The MERGE statement is optimized for merging sets of data.

	 		MERGE INTO target_table target_alias
	 		USING(source table|view|subquery) source_alias
	 		ON (join_condition)
	 		WHEN MATCHED THEN
	 			UPDATE SET
	 				column_name_1 = value_1,
	 				column_name_2 = value_2,
	 				...
	 				[WHERE <update condition>]
	 			[DELETE WHERE <delete condition>]
	 		WHEN NO MATCHED THEN
	 			INSERT (columns) VALUES (values)
	 			[WHERE <insert condtions>];

	 		MERGE INTO employees_copy c
			USING employees e

			WHEN MATCHED THEN
			    UPDATE SET c.first_name = e.first_name,
			               c.last_name  = e.last_name,

			    DELETE WHERE department_id IS NULL
			WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
			    INSERT VALUES(e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, e.email,
			                  e.phone_number, e.hire_date,  e.job_id, e.salary,
